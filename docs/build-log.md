# Build log

What was built or changed in each session, and why. Newest section at the
bottom. Past sections are not rewritten.

---

## 1. 2026-10-22 — Project rules

- Added `CLAUDE.md` with the repo's first rules: browser-only operations
  (owner has no CLI; all ops through an `/ops` page modeled on the MCCE repo),
  the 500-line cap with ask-before-adding, and the split between this log,
  the README, and `CLAUDE.md`. On the owner's yes, also added: plan
  Requirements need her say-so, the unclean-food hard block, and a restore
  for every destructive `/ops` control. Family isolation was offered and left
  out.
- Added this build log and rewrote `README.md` to point at it.
- Reviewed `cooking-class-app-PLAN.md` and found gaps (diet-flag semantics,
  unclean-food enforcement relying on a hand-set flag, untested recipes,
  scaling rules, missing schema fields, iOS timer limits, kid access to parent
  screens, unphased features, art workload). None are folded into the plan
  yet.
- Nothing is built.

## 2. 2026-10-22 — Plan review fixes folded in

Folded the entry 1 review into `cooking-class-app-PLAN.md`. Plan only; nothing
is built.

- **Food rules:** the registry's `diet` flags became a `contains` tag list,
  because the old sample marked flour `gluten: false`. Animal-derived
  ingredients need an `animalSource`, which the linter checks against a
  clean-species allowlist; before this, the hard block relied on a hand-set
  `unclean` flag. A blocked-word scan of lesson text was added, and
  substitutions are now checked. Lard in masa and shortening was added to the
  hidden sources, and casing notes were added to lessons 30 and 39.
- **Food safety:** added doneness-check steps with thermometer targets,
  wash-hands steps after raw handling, pasteurized eggs for lesson 31, and a
  raw-dough tip.
- **Curriculum:** lesson 3 is broiled rather than fried, so its safety level
  stays correct. Lesson 43's safety is now plain "Adult nearby."
- **Scaling and units (§6.6–6.7):** free vs. fixed multipliers, rounding for
  countable items, notes per multiplier, measurable fractions, US customary
  display.
- **Prerequisites:** a lesson hidden by a family's filters no longer blocks
  the lessons that require it.
- **Testing:** each lesson needs a `tested` record before kids see it.
- **Schema:**
  - Lessons gained `version`, an image, `totalMinutes`, skill IDs, a cuisine
    ID, `scaling`, ingredient groups and optional ingredients, stable step IDs,
    and timer labels.
  - New registries for equipment, skills, and cuisines.
- **Data model:**
  - `kids.rank` was removed; it contradicted "rank is computed."
  - `queue` gained `id`, `servings`, and a `requested` status for kid
    requests.
  - Shopping trips replaced the undefined `list_key`.
  - `safety_overrides` is keyed by step ID, not index.
  - The `family_id` rule now covers `invites`, and the owner's endpoints are
    stated as the one exception to family scoping.
- **Owner:** removed "by default" from the owner's cross-family view, which
  conflicted with §2.5. Added owner password reset, and removal of a family
  with a restore.
- **Offline and platform:** the shopping list, attempt progress, and photo
  uploads now work offline. Added iOS limits for timers, sound, and Wake Lock.
- **Operations:** added §8.5 for `/ops` (migrations, backup export/import, a
  restore for every destructive control, setup the owner does in the
  dashboard), per `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Phases:**
  - Phase 0 includes the kids' theme pick and the core art set.
  - `/ops` and profiles moved to 1b.
  - Attempts are saved in Phase 2.
  - Safety review and per-step safety edits are in Phase 3.
  - Added a testing line for every phase.
- **Art:** added an art production plan (§5.3a).
- **Open questions:** added 7–12 (allergies per kid, lowering safety levels,
  a required PIN, rennet/blood/fat, who test-cooks, who makes the art). The PIN
  and rennet/blood/fat questions touch Requirements (§2.5, §2.1), so they are
  questions rather than changes.

---

## 3. 2026-10-22 — Test-cooking optional; helper and first run added to plan

- **Test-cooking is optional.** The owner reversed entry 2's rule that a
  lesson had to be test-cooked before kids could see it. Removed the lesson
  `tested` field, its linter warning, the test-cook conditions in the Phase 1
  and Phase 7 done-when lines, and the open question on who test-cooks.
- **Parents can mark a lesson test-cooked** for their own family. It's stored
  in a new `test_cooks` table and shows as a test-kitchen stamp, not a pill.
- **First-time parents get a warning** that the recipes may not have been
  cooked yet. It's part of the first-run wizard, and shows as a one-time notice
  until the wizard is built.
- **Helper (§6.8):** a brief entry for a scripted helper modeled on Kels from
  KennelOS, used by both kids and parents. Full spec later.
- **First-run wizard (§6.9):** a brief entry modeled on the KennelOS first run
  and "Getting Started." Full spec later.
- **Phase 8:** added for the helper and the first-run wizard.
- Open question "who makes the art" is now number 11.

---

## 4. 2026-10-22 — Allergies are per family

- The owner ruled that diet filters are per family, not per kid. §2.1 now
  says so, and the open question on it was removed. The remaining open
  questions were renumbered 7–10.

---

## 5. 2026-10-22 — Safety levels are banners only, set in content

- The owner ruled that the safety banner is enough (nothing locks a step or
  waits for an adult) and that parents can't change safety levels.
- Removed "Edit safety levels" from parent features, the `safety_overrides`
  table, and per-step safety edits from Phase 3. §3 now says a level is
  information only.
- Removed the open questions on adult hands-on unlocking and on lowering levels.
  The PIN question now covers only kids approving their own lesson requests.
  Open questions renumbered 1–8.
- Fixed a stale linter line that still named the removed `unclean` flag; it now
  points to `animalSource` and the blocked-word list.

---

## 6. 2026-10-22 — Required parent PIN; password reset by email

- **Parent PIN is required.** The owner ruled yes on requiring it. Before
  this it was optional, so a kid on a kitchen device could reach parent
  screens and approve their own lesson requests. Now:
  - Every parent-only screen asks for the PIN.
  - The PIN is set in the first run.
  - A parent resets a forgotten PIN by entering their account password.
- **Password reset by email through Resend.** This replaces "reset by the
  owner only"; the owner's reset stays as a fallback.
  - New `password_resets` table; the link expires after an hour.
  - Setup now lists the `RESEND_API_KEY` secret and verifying the sending
    domain in Resend.
  - Added to Phase 1b.
- Removed the PIN open question. Open questions renumbered 1–7.

---

## 7. 2026-10-22 — Profiles: single or shared, and lessons for several

- **Profiles can be shared.** The owner ruled that a profile can be one kid
  or several kids sharing it; the family chooses per kid, shared, or a mix.
  Before this, every attempt belonged to exactly one kid, so kids cooking
  together had no way to share credit, and the shopping list bought twice.
- **A queued lesson can be for one or more profiles**, and they cook it as one
  cook:
  - One shopping-list count and one photo.
  - Every profile on it gets the stamp and pin.
  - Each profile writes its own reflection.
- **Data model:**
  - `kids` became `profiles`.
  - `queue.kid_id` became a `queue_profiles` join table.
  - `attempts` lost `kid_id`, `rating`, and `notes`; a new `attempt_profiles`
    table holds each profile's place on the cook and its reflection.
- Updated the users section (§1 Profiles), kid and parent features, family
  settings, the shopping list's counting rule, the first run, the beginner
  track's data hooks (kids on different tracks need separate profiles), and
  Phases 1b and 2.
- Removed the "cook together or separately" open question. Open questions
  renumbered 1–6.

## 8. 2026-10-22 — Theme choice, open sign-up, family recipes

Owner rulings on open questions:
- **No extra diet filters for the owner's family.** Removed the question;
  per-family filters stay as a feature for other families.
- **The kids choose the theme.** §5.2 now states it as a Requirement. Whether
  each family can pick its own theme is still open.
- **Open sign-up, gated by a code or keyword.** This replaces invite-only.
  - Anyone can request a code through a public form; the owner approves it from
    a queue, which emails a single-use code through Resend.
  - The owner can also set a shared sign-up keyword, and change it or turn it
    off.
  - Added `signup_requests` and `settings`; `invites` gained `email`.
- **Family recipes, a bonus feature (§6.10, Phase 9).**
  - Families add their own recipes through a guided step-by-step flow (no CSV
    or file import) and cook them in the lesson player.
  - They can submit a recipe for owner review; released recipes go into a
    searchable community directory any family can add from.
  - The hard block and diet filters apply to all of it. Typed-in ingredients
    that aren't in the registry rely on the blocked-word scan alone until the
    owner adds them; this is stated as a known gap.
  - Added `family_recipes`, `recipe_submissions`, and `community_recipes`.
  - Family recipes live in D1; the library stays as content files.
- Replaced "cook-together mode" in the Later row with "split roles," since
  shared profiles (entry 7) already cover cooking together.
- Open questions are now 1–3.

---

## 9. 2026-10-22 — Theme per profile

- The owner ruled that **each profile picks its own theme**. This replaces
  entry 8's open question about one theme for everyone vs. one per family.
- §5.2 rewritten:
  - Themes share the same rewards underneath and draw them differently.
  - Each theme supplies every §5.4 component; §5.4 is now the Chef's Passport
    treatment.
  - The theme switches when a profile is picked. The picker and parent screens
    use a neutral house style.
  - One theme is built first, chosen by the kids in Phase 0; more come later.
- `profiles` gained `theme`. Family settings and the kids' first run include
  picking it.
- The beginner track no longer says "same theme as core"; beginner profiles
  pick from the same themes.
- The art section notes that each added theme needs its own art set.
- Open questions are now 1–2.

---

## 10. 2026-10-22 — Blood and fat blocked; Claude draws the art; adult profiles

- **Blood and fat added to the hard block (§2.1).** The owner ruled yes on
  blood and fat. Rennet and pepsin were not included.
  - Blood is blocked from any animal. Fat from cattle, sheep, and goats (suet,
    tallow, beef dripping) is blocked.
  - Suet and beef tallow were added to the hidden sources.
  - A new registry field, `animalPart`, lets the linter catch these, since the
    species check alone passes cattle. The blocked-word list gained suet,
    tallow, beef dripping, blood sausage, and black pudding.
- **Claude draws the art** as SVG, judged at the Phase 0 showcase. Removed the
  open question.
- **Adults can take the class.**
  - Each profile is marked kid or adult in the first run (`profiles.audience`);
    a shared profile with any kid on it is a kid profile.
  - On adult profiles, safety banners show only the hazard.
  - Added "Adult learner" to the users table.
- No open questions remain.

---

## 11. 2026-10-22 — Fat rule scope

- The owner ruled that the fat rule covers separable fat only (suet, tallow,
  beef dripping sold as a fat). Marbling and cooking drippings are allowed;
  §2.1 now says so. No lesson changes were needed.
